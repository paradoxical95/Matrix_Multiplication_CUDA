Simple Matrix Multiplication in CUDA. Fills the Arrays and Multiplies them as a linear arrangement.
As evident from the screenshots, CUDA is really fast. Matrices were 1024*1024 but I only printed 5 and 10 in each case.
Nvprof was unsupported so I resorted to simple timing events/chrono to record the execution time.
